General timeline
========

The project can be broken down into two main phases or outcomes - the first is
to refactor the module system, and the second is to integrate with Composer. The
current (very rough) planned timeline is:

* **7th - 21st May** Project and API planning, and discussion on how the system
  should be implemented.
* **21st May** GSOC starts.
* **21st May - 9th July** Refactoring the module system.
* **9th July** Midterm evaluations.
* **9th July - 13th August** Integration with Composer.
* **13th August** GSOC finishes.

This will be expanded on as GSOC approaches.

### May 21 - May 28

**Planned**

* Autoloading investigation - PSR, manifest only?
* Writing a PHP class parser to work around limitations of first loading all classes, as well as being able to generate more specific data to SS

* Initial proof of concept composer installer (https://github.com/ajshort/silverstripe-composer-installer)
